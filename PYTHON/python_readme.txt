# THIS IS SAVED AS A TEXT FILE BUT YOU CAN ENABLE COLOUR SPECIFIC SYNTAX TO HELP READ THE INFORMATION
# CLICK ON ^vIEW IN SUBLIME MENU - LOOK FOR 'SYNTAX' - IT IS ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE LIST OF OPTIONS - EXPAND THE SYNTAX OPTION AND SELECT "BASH" (ONE OF THE FIRST FEW LANGUAGE OPTIONS)
# YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW BASH - IT IS JUST A WAY TO SEE THE INFORMATION THAT IS IN THIS FILE WITH APPROPRIATE COLOUR DISTICTIONS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMANDS, STEPS, AND COMMENTS 
#
# I NEED TO GET A VERSION OF PROCESSING - VERSION 3.5.4 IS WHAT WORKS WITH PYTHON
# YOU PROBABLY ALREADY HAVE V3.5.4 INSTALLED FROM LAST SEMESTER
#
# PATH-TO: THIS IS WHERE YOU ADD YOUR OWN DIRECTORY PATH TO GET TO WHERE PROCESSING WILL BE INSTALLED/IS INSTALLED
# ONLY INSTALL IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! (OR NEED THE NEW VERSION)
# IF YOU CLONE THE REPO IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY DOWNLOAD INTO A FOLDER CALLED processing-3.5.4
# CLONING IS USING GIT - WHICH WE WILL USE WITH GITHUB - IT IS LIKE TAKING A COPY OF THE REPOSITORY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU DID WHEN YOU COPIED/CLONED MY REPO FROM CLASS
# 
# IF YOU FORKED THE REPO WE WILL CLARIFY FORK VS CLONE NEXT WEEK | IF I HAVE TIME I'LL MAKE A VIDEO ON THE WEEKEND
# YOU CAN DOWNLOAD PROCESSING FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS ON PROCESSING WEBSITE
