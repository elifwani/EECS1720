# Plans for 100 Days of Code
These projects will be in different repos (as to not make a mess) but some of the things I will be working on and exploring are:
* Learning C++ for Game Development 
<br> Many companies require it and none of the courses I am taking right now are teaching it.
* Development for VR
<br> I have an Oculus Quest 2, so I thought it would be amazing to be able to play/experience things I create in VR.
* Conductive painting
<br> I saw a painting on TikTok in which the artist used conductive paint in some parts of the piece and made the art piece a "piano". I want to take inspiration from that and createe something of that sort myself.
* TouchDesigner
